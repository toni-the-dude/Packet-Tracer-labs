### Take 1

- I have to figure out how to properly connect to console via the laptop in the lab.
- I have to find out how exactly do I tell broadcast domains apart, as well as interfaces in use.

### Take 2

- I finally realized that the cyan arching lines represent a console connection.
- Telling broadcast domains is easy enough if all you have to analyze is VLANs.
